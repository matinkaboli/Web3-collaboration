## Development Roadmap
We have an expert and motivated team in the field of designing and building wallets
and we would like to cooperate with the Polkadot team. Our main goal in every
single project is to have a modern and beautiful design with suitable user interface to
make users feel comfortable with the app, and also make it easy for other
developers to contribute and develop the project. We meet & learn about your
business and set goals for the project. We have gained enough experience in
designing and building wallets in the past year.

Our team has built a cross-platform desktop wallet for NKN network which according
to users' feedback is very modern and useful and also the NKN community gave
good feedback to us.

We also learn as much as possible about your competitors. This way we can give you
the best, most unique design solution possible.

**Designing:** Study current and potential users to see what they need and want. Then
design the app with 2 different modes (dark and light).

**Testing:** It’s always necessary to test and review the app and try to make it faster
and better in every way possible.

**Maintain:** It’s our duty to maintain the app and fix the issues and bugs to make users
happy.

## Fund and Milestone

It takes 6 weeks to complete the application and publish the app.

Our stimate fund request is 10,000 USD.

## Additional Information

We have already designed some of the pages.

We have applied for other grants like [Tron grant](https://tronaccelerator.io/)
and our team could get USDT 10,000.
